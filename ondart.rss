    <title>A year of fun and hard work on learning Dart</title>
    <link>http://dzenanr.github.com/2012/10/14/year-on-dart.html</link>

    <description>
      For me, it was a fun year of learning Dart, more fun when developing and less fun when writing about it. My software projects help me teach better. My teaching efforts help me explore new research avenues. My research activities help me develop better. And those are spirals as well, n'est-ce pas?

    <title>From Spiral12 To Spiral13</title>

      In Spiral 12, a model may be saved in a local storage under a model name and later opened by using the model name. A type of a data attribute may be changed from default String to another type. Based on the current item obtained by the Get 1 button (where 1 is determined by the name in the item input field), the next item may be selected by the Get +1 (Next) button.
      <br/>
      In Spiral 13, there are only minor changes. In the Menu Bar, the File menu is renamed to Model. A model may be opened, saved and closed. In the Tool Bar, the Get 1 (item) button is renamed, as it used to be, to Get. The sequence of buttons is rearranged, so that buttons with -1 are now after buttons with +1.

      In Spiral 11, a model may be transformed to JSON and back from JSON to a model.  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. JSON is easy for humans to understand and for software to parse it. It is based on two data structures: a collection of name/value pairs {} and an ordered list of values [].

      In Spiral 10, a relationship created between two concepts, may be changed to inheritance or is-a relationship, 
      first by selecting the relationship line, second by getting information about the relationship in the tool bar, 
      third by choosing the inheritance category in the pop-up list. 
      Similarly, the obtained relationship may be categorized as reflexive or twin. 
      A reflexive relationship will connect the parent concept to itself. 
      Two relationships between the same two concepts will split apart when becoming twins.

      In Spiral 09, line min..max cardinalities may be changed by getting the selected line with 
      a click on the Get button in the tool bar, making changes and setting them with a click on the Set button. 
      Line direction names may be added. 
      A line direction with 1..1 cardinalities may become a part of the identifier of the source concept.

      In Spiral 05, there is a tool bar that provides a new way of creating, selecting and moving boxes. 
      In Spiral 06, a menu bar provides four buttons to select all boxes, to delete selected boxes, 
      to hide selected boxes and to show hidden boxes. A line tool in the tool bar, 
      allows a line creation between the last two clicked boxes.

      In Spiral 04, each box has a title with the sequential number and (x, y) coordinates, and the same four items. 
      In Spiral 05, boxes have the same appearance, but there is a tool bar that provides a new way of creating, selecting and moving boxes.

      In Spiral 03, a box may be created by clicking on an empty space in the board, selected and then moved.
      In Spiral 04, each box has a title and the same four items. A box title has an incremental number and its (x, y) coordinates within the board. 
      A box is moved only if it is selected and if the mouse is pressed down.
