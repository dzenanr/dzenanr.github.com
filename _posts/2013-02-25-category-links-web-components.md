The Category Links application has a simple model with two concepts and one relationship (Figure 1).

**Figure 1**: Graphical model.

This model is introduced in the [Category Links Model in dartlero] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I4PX1rBX7BemxYM3MitUN75UKwExUCLxhG8nIrbhBXs/edit?usp=sharing) document. The model and its corresponding web components for displaying, adding, editing, removing and saving data are part of the [dartlero_category_links] (https://github.com/dzenanr/dartlero_category_links) project. If you want to see a step-by-step development of the Category Links application, consult the [dartlero_category_links_spirals] (https://github.com/dzenanr/dartlero_category_links_spirals) project.

The application page uses several web components. Two of them are presented in Figure 2.
