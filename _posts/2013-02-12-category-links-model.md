I have created the Category Links application to show how to use data in a simple model through web components. Both the model and its corresponding web components for displaying, adding, editing, removing and saving data are part of the [dartlero_category_links] (https://github.com/dzenanr/dartlero_category_links) application project.

A model for the Category Links application has two concepts and one relationship (Figure 1).

**Figure 1**: Graphical model.

The application page uses several web components. Two of them are presented in Figure 2.

The model is explained in the [Category Links Model in dartlero] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I4PX1rBX7BemxYM3MitUN75UKwExUCLxhG8nIrbhBXs/edit?usp=sharing) document. The web components will be explained in the next blog post.
