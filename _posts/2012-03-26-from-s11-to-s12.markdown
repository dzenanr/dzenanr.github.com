Code

The code for the MagicBoxes project is at [MagicBoxes on GitHub] (https://github.com/dzenanr/MagicBoxes). The code for the mb project is at [mb on GitHub] (https://github.com/dzenanr/mb). For teaching or learning purposes, each spiral in MagicBoxes is decomposed into several steps in mb.

If you use Spirals 00 ... 11 locally, checkout branches s00a ... s11a.

Overview
--------

In Spiral 11, a model may be transformed to [JSON] (http://www.json.org/) and back from JSON to a model. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. JSON is easy for humans to understand and for software to parse it. It is based on two data structures: a collection of name/value pairs \{\} and an ordered list of values \[\]. 

In Spiral 12, a model may be saved in a [local storage] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_storage) under a model name and later opened by using the model name. A type of a property may be changed from default String to another type. Based on the current item obtained by the Get button, the next item may be selected by the Get Next button.
